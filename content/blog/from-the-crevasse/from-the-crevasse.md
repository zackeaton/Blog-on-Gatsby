I am crawling out from the crevasse. Both mentally and physically. Yesterday I spent some much needed time updating my personal laptop. After months of neglect from keeping things up-to-date, everything hit at once. My personal dev site is unable to be updated due to a couple out of date files. I should probably redo everything again and start from scratch.
